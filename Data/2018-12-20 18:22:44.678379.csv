"147,950",Help James McCarthy in his battle against leukemia,U.S. Dollar,,of $100k goal,944,"How you can help: Donate to James’ care: https://fundrazr.com/campaigns/f1OA33/pay Register to be a bone marrow donor: http://www.bethematch.org/ James’ Story: On Tuesday, August 7th we were leaving the house for Rita’s birthday
  dinner when we received a voicemail from James’ doctor. She said to call immediately and left her personal cell phone
    number. As we walked, James was being his usual self:
  running down Southport Ave and acting like a healthy, happy little
  boy. Forty-eight hours later, James would be in critical
  condition, on a ventilator, and fighting for his life.  Two days after
  that James was diagnosed with an extremely rare form of Leukemia. When we called the doctor back, she shared that a routine blood test
  showed James’ white blood cell count was abnormally high and she
  wanted us to get more tests done by the Leukemia and cancer
  specialists at Lurie’s Children Hospital. To put it in
  perspective, healthy children usually have a white blood cell count of
  5,000 to 10,000. James’ was at 32,000. Thursday was the soonest appointment we could get with a hematologist
  - a doctor who specializes in diseases of the blood. The
  doctors at Lurie’s confirmed that something was not right. They wanted to get a bone marrow sample to figure out what was
  going on and the quickest way to the front of the line was to have
  James admitted. At that point, there wasn’t a high level
  of concern for James’ immediate health. We spent the day
  playing with trucks, reading books, watching “gee” (Curious George)
  and looking at cars, trucks, buses and all his favorite sights of the
  city from the hospital room window. On Friday morning at 9:30 am, James underwent a procedure to extract
  a bone marrow and a bone sample from his hip. The
  doctor’s shared what they were testing for: James likely either had
  Leukemia or an auto-immune disease. Devastation. A few hours later the oncologist (cancer doctor) called us to the
  consultation room for a discussion. She shared what was
  seemingly good news. The initial blood results had ruled
  out the most common types of Leukemia, which typically make up more
  than 99% of annual childhood Leukemia diagnosis. The
  only cancer they couldn’t rule out was a very rare form of Leukemia
  called Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, or JMML. We
  would later learn that JMML is so rare that there are currently only
  20 kids diagnosed in the U.S. While we didn’t yet have an answer for what was affecting James, we
  cautiously celebrated the news since the other options were an auto
  immune disease or pneumonia.  We were told the rest of the tests would
  likely come back on Monday. That night James’ health rapidly deteriorated. His
  temperature spiked to 104. His heart rate was racing at
  200 beats per minute. His lungs began to fail. To help his little body the nurses and doctors put him on
  oxygen and a few IVs. While we were scared – and not
  knowing what was happening – we at least had the benefit of being able
  to talk to the doctors. James didn’t. As the night progressed, the doctor’s wanted to increase his oxygen
  to help with his lungs; and to do so, he needed to be moved to the
  Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) and only they could administer
  the higher dosage. For the next 24-hours, James would not rest; his body would not let
    him. Each time he did fall asleep, he would wake up 10
  to 20 minutes later terrified and not knowing what was happening.  His
  body was in overdrive, IVs and sensors all over his body, a tube
  inserted down his nose into his stomach – how could he understand? It was excruciating. His body was being
    overworked. He was having trouble breathing. He was not getting the rest needed. He was
  pleading with all the words he had.  “All done.” “Momma.” “Up.”
  “Outside.” It was heartbreaking and terrifying to watch
  our poor little baby so scared and so sick, feeling completely helpless. The PICU team told us what we could already see.  James’ body
  could not sustain this pace on his own, so we made the decision to
  sedate and intubate him (put on a breathing machine.) It
  was mentally impossible to hear but we knew it had to be done.  We sat
  bedside with James as he was sedated and the breathing tubes inserted
  into his lungs.  This was two days after we walked into the hospital
  with a seemingly healthy little boy. Saturday brought a new bombshell. The only piece of
  good news we had received instantly disappeared. Our
  James had JMML, the rarest type of childhood Leukemia. The doctors now suspected that James did not have pneumonia. Instead it was leukemia filling his little lungs with white
  blood cells. James’ white blood cell count accelerated
  rapidly throughout the day from 30,000 (which we previously thought
  was unimaginably high) to 50,000 to 78,000 to 90,000 to 111,000 to 128,000. Our little James was now in critical condition. Some of
  the best doctors in Chicago were working with him minute-by-minute,
  hour-by-hour to keep him going. Everything had happened
  so fast that we didn’t even have time to process one bit of news
  before we had moved onto another. But we kept in mind
  one thing: if you’ve met James, you know he is a strong-willed little
    toddler. If anyone can battle this, it’s James. While James’ lungs were responding to the breathing machine, it
  wasn’t enough.  The doctors decided to move him to a
  new ventilator that could also administer anesthesia gas in addition
  to breathing for James.  This machine had to be brought up from the
  E.R. and had only been used a few times on the PICU floor over the
  past two years. We were told James may be the sickest
  patient in the hospital (438 patients) and that he was fighting for
  his life. We were grasping for straws. The doctors told us they
  were running out of things to try. We
  discussed unproven options that had never been tried on a patient as
  young as James. We signed consent forms. Fortunately, the new machine began to stabilize James and we took
  some of those options off the table.  During “rounds” the next
  morning we counted thirteen doctors and nurses around James’ room to
  get an update on his condition.  We felt like we were in the right
  place with the right level of attention from an incredibly experienced
  medical staff. We had tremendous support from family and
  friends – all rallying around James and supporting us day and night. On Sunday, August 12th- just 5 days after receiving that urgent
  call from the doctor - James started Chemo. His chemo is
  now administered twice a day. Once for
    30-minutes. Later in the day for 4-hours. He typically also requires a blood transfusion. This is in addition to the 18-25 drips of medication he is on
  every hour. As crazy as it sounds, this is only part of the story over the past
  week. There have been other challenges with blood
  pressure, his lungs filling with carbon dioxide (CO2), scary
  challenges switching him to new medical machinery, but tough little
  James is making progress. On Wednesday the 15th he moved
  to a smaller ventilator. His white blood cells are down
  to 30,000. While still on anesthesia, James has been resting in bed with his
  night time puppy, Curious George stuffed animal and a pacifier in one
  hand and his favorite toy truck in the other. We have
  been reading James books, which is very difficult while keeping your
  emotions in check. James has a long fight in front of him. It’s scary to
  think about all the challenges ahead but right now we are focused on
  today. One step at a time, then we will tackle the next target. Ultimately, the only cure for JMML is a bone marrow transplant, in
  addition to extensive chemotherapy over the coming months until we
  find the appropriate donor match. If you want to see if
  you would be a match for James, please register at the website below. Nearly 5,000 kids will be diagnosed with Leukemia this year. There are a lot of kids like James out there whose only hope is
  to find a good donor match. You can do it from your own
  home and it’s as easy as swabbing the inside of your cheek. Please visit: http://www.bethematch.org/ You can learn more about JMML at: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juvenile_myelomonocytic_leukemia Please keep James in your thoughts and prayers.  He’s the
  sweetest little boy you’ll ever meet. We can’t wait to
  hear his voice again. To see his kind blue eyes. To have him blow us a kiss with a smile. I love
    you James. You can donate to James’ care at https://fundrazr.com/campaigns/f1OA33/pay",https://fundrazr.com/f1OA33
"1,430",Heal the healer - Help for Pak Sadra,Euro,"Jan 1, 2019",of €2.3k goal,18,"My name is Franziska, and just like you, I have been a guest at
  Ashram Gandhi - a place that, to many of us, has become sort of a
  Balinese home, nurturing our bodies, minds and hearts. During the last year, I have visited the Ashram five times and every
  time I went, it became a bit more like home. One of the key reasons
  for that is Pak Sadra's presence, care and welcoming spirit. He has
  not only given me acupunctural treatments, but welcomed me and my
  family at his home in Tenganan. He enriched my mind and spirit in our
  conversations about religion, philosophy and his travels. In fact he
  has become like a father to me, as he has to the Ashram members and
  many, many others. In early November, Pak Sadra's health condition deteriorated bruskly,
  and it required a surgery in the end in order to treat a very painful
  prostate inflamation. This process and required hospitalisation
  thereafter has exhausted his life savings of 2.500 USD completely, as
  the insurance did not cover the intervention at the hospital he was attended. Pak Sadra, who as been healing everybody in need, no matter their
  economic circumstances, now needs our support to be healed himself.
  Let's help him pay for his surgery, so he can recover faster and go
  back to healing others! With his campaign, we will send 100% of the raised funds directly to
  Pak Sadra as a sign of our deep gratitude and support. He does not know of this campaign to keep it a surprise until we have
  raised a good amount of funds, but I am coordinating with people in
  his very close environment to verify his needs and situation. I'm happy to clear any doubts or questions - please get in touch!",https://fundrazr.com/HealPakSadra

  cancer. He is currently undergoing immunotherapy treatment at Kaiser
  which has had some promising results for others so we're hoping for
  the best. However, like all cancer treatments the side effects have
  caused him a great deal of fatigue making it impossible for him to
  work during this time. We recently discovered that because he was employed by a church
  before his diagnosis he is unable to draw from unemployment insurance
  or state disability funds as they aren't legally required to
  contribute to them. We are hoping that he will be able to qualify for
  social security but have been informed that if he does qualify he
  won't receive a check for another 6 months as his claim works it's way
  through that system. We're hoping to raise $12,000 to cover him over the next six months.
  This will cover his rent, utilities, co-pays, travel and food over
  this time and relieve a great deal of stress from him as he

"68,410",URGENTLY NEEDED New Hips for Christian McCudden!!,Australian Dollar,"Dec 21, 2018",of $81k goal,32,"Hi, my wife and I have been friends with Christian and Melissa for nearly
    twenty years... it has been many years since we have caught up with
    this wonderful family and after a recent phone conversation with
    Christian we have only just now learned of the ongoing physical
    hardship he has been going through over the years and the very
    difficult decision he has just had to make..... After our chat I thought there has to be something we can do to
    help, so I have setup this campaign in the hope that you will all
    join us in standing together to make a massive difference to
    Christian’s upcoming journey! Following is a snapshot of the McCudden family and Christian’s
    journey so far and the reasons why our donations are so very vital
    and impactful at this time for them... Christian has been married to Melissa for 21 yrs. and they have
    3 three amazing children, Noah, Ella and Zachary. In 2013 Christian & Melissa moved from their home in
    Sydney's northern beaches leaving family, friends and working at C3
    Oxford falls as one of the full time pastors, and planted C3 church
    Noosa, launching in May of 2013. Prior to planting C3 Noosa they were a part of C3 Oxford falls
    for 20 years. Over that time Christian fulfilled many roles in various
  areas including: Youth ministry for 12yrs / Pastoring / Lecturing in the Bible College. Travelled with and assisted Ps Phil for 6 years. Project managed the buildings and renovations that went on over the
  years at C3 Oxford falls. Christian has also over many years ministered in Church's throughout
  Australia, New Zealand, America, Europe, Asia and Indonesia seeing
  many people saved, healed and touched by the power of God. He has also seen over the year’s incredible healings and testimonies. Blind eyes opened / Deaf ears opened / Cancer healed Crippled people getting out of wheel chairs / Stroke patients healed
  and walking and speaking. Pain leaving bodies immediately / Blood conditions healed / People
  who were suicidal set free Dead raised to life / Arthritis conditions healed Broken bones healed instantly… and many more stories to be told. Christian and Melissa have now been on the Sunshine Coast QLD for 5
  1/2 years with C3 Noosa just celebrating its 5th birthday.  A church
  that is vibrant, growing, and impacting many lives in their local
  community and beyond. As this all still continues to grow and function
  Christian currently works part time for their church C3 Noosa and full
  time as a carpenter, building on job sites. Over the past 8 years Christian has
    suffered with pain in his body from a gradual degenerative arthritic
    condition in both his hips. In the past 4 years the pain has become
    very intense with major side effects such as only being able to
    sleep a couple of sound hours a night, having limited movement,
    unable to exercise or do the physical things he loves to do and
    especially with his kids. Two years ago Christian had the
    opportunity to go over to the U.S to get stem cell treatment in both
    hips which has helped to a small degree but has not been able to see
    the full benefits due to his current working activity of being on
    the tools building. Building over the last few years
      has taken a huge toll on his body and made the pain more intense.
      Christian has now come to a place where he cannot physically
      continue to do his work labouring as a builder, due to the extreme
      pain and limited movement. He has no other option left other than to proceed with
      further treatment being a double hip replacement! A double hip replacement and the extensive rehabilitation
        involved is quite costly and the road to full recovery is a good
        6 to12 months! In a matter of days Christian will have no income from building as he has had to give notice and quit due to his bodies inability
    to function sufficiently in the way needed to perform his role as a
    builder and his bodies pain levels have reached a crippling level. Christian needs our help NOW! The results from this will be amazing! It will give Christian back his quality of life! It will give
      him back the things that we take for granted like having a full
      night’s sleep, having no crippling pain, being able to exercise,
      and the ability to do normal life activities with his children
      while they are still young! We would love to enable Christian to get this surgery done ASAP
      and for him to have the appropriate time required for a full recovery. It is a costly procedure and the post-operative rehabilitation
      expenses required will be quite high. To enable Christian to have the procedure and the necessary
        time off not needing to labour physically in the building
        industry is a minimum of six months..... So that’s what we have
        based the amount of funds needed to raise on: - The double hip
        replacement surgery, rehabilitation and physical therapy for six
        months and funds to keep the family afloat while Christian is
        unable to work. So we kindly ask you to consider donating to help bless
        Christian and his family at this time as they make plans towards
        treatment, surgery and rehabilitation. Christian has been such a faithful servant and blessing to so
      many lives over the years. A servant’s heart through and through
      and one of the most generous people you will ever meet. If you are reading this then you have probably been blessed in
        some form either directly or indirectly from the big hearted
        kindness of this faithful man. We now we get the opportunity to sow back into this rich soil of
    an amazing family and help them in their time of need! They are so humble and never complain most people wouldn’t even
      know about this ongoing struggle over the years and how Christian
      has been enduring such pain in his body while going about blessing others! Let’s all band together to quickly raise the funds for this
        much needed surgery! If we all dig deep, give what we can and pass this on to our
        various friends and networks then Christian will be on the road
        to recovery before we know it... Thank you all for your thoughts, prayers and generous donations.... God Bless!!",https://fundrazr.com/f1MWCb

  colegi ai Oanei Raluca COCAN . Oana e din București. E un om obișnuit; are 44 de ani, e căsătorită
  și are doi copii: o fată de 14 ani și un băiat de 9 ani. Pagina ei de
  Facebook, unde publică vești, e https://www.facebook.com/ralucaoana.cocan . În urmă cu 6 ani a primit un diagnostic de cancer de col uterin.
  Vestea a căzut ca un trăsnet asupra ei și a familiei. Însă cu
  optimismul care o caracterizează, cu ajutorul prietenilor și al lui
  Dumnezeu, a câștigat lupta. Viața a reintrat în normal; copiii s-au
  făcut mari, părinții au crescut și ei. Acum însă boala s-a întors și a
  afectat deja un rinichi, ureterul drept și vena iliacă. Oana are din
  nou nevoie de ajutorul nostru. În prezent ea este la Helios Klinikum din Berlin, Germania. După o
  primă investigație și o operație (tentativă nereușită) de salvare a
  unuia dintre rinichi, planul de bătaie înseamnă șase săptămâni de
  radioterapie, posibil combinată cu chimioterapie. Operația nu este
  posibilă din cauza amplasării afecțiunii. Terapia depășește posibilitățile financiare ale familiei ei. Are
  nevoie de 15.000 EUR . Copiii și soțul ei, și noi de
  asemenea, o vrem în continuare alături de noi. După câștigarea acestei lupte, cu permisiunea voastră, banii eventual
  rămași vor fi donați unei organizații care se ocupă de cazuri similare. Vă rugăm donați pentru Oana. Și rugați-vă pentru ea. Prin această pagină puteți dona doar

  with 2 children: a girl (14) and a boy (9). Here is her Facebook page
  where she is posting updates: https://www.facebook.com/ralucaoana.cocan . Six years ago, she received a uterine cancer diagnostic. The news
  came as a hammer upon her and her family. Yet with her optimism and
  with the help of her friends and God, she overcame that trial. Life
  went back to normal; the kids grew older, so did the parents. Now the
  disease is back and has already reached a kidney, the right-hand
  ureter and the iliac vein. Once again, Oana needs our help. Now she’s at the Helios Klinikum in Berlin. After a first
  investigation and a failed surgery to save one of the kidneys, the
  approach means 6 weeks of radiotherapy, possibly combine with chemo.
  Surgical removal of the tumor is not possible because of the location. The said therapy exceeds the financial means of her family. We need EUR 15,000 . Her children and husband want her back
  in good shape. We too. After winning this battle, with your permission, any and all money
  remained will be donated to a charity dealing with similar cases. Please donate for Oana. And pray for her. You can donate here only through

  January 7th, 2019. Please do not send any samples back during
    this time either as your sample will be held up in the university
    mailing system until we return, which will affect your sample
    quality. If you are sending your sample the week prior to December
    22nd, please make sure it will arrive by December 21st. __________________________________________________ This is a unique open collaboration between the TwinsUK team at King's College London and The American Gut Project (AGP) / The Microsetta Initiative to expand the study of the bacterial diversity to
    participants in Europe. If you are a participant living outside Europe and would like
    to participate, please refer to our American Gut Fundrazr page . Many
  people don't realize that the bacteria that live inside us play an
  incredibly important role in our health. There are so many of them:
  They make up 50 percent of the cells in our body and their most
  important jobs include manufacturing vitamins for us and breaking down
  and digesting our food. The trillions of bacteria in our gut weigh
  nearly 2 kg (over 4lbs). This community of bacteria can be thought of
  as an extra 'organ' which we call our ""microbiome"".  Recent
  research has discovered that small changes in this finely balanced
  community can affect our immune system, metabolism, body weight, mood
  and may even cause diseases such as Crohn's disease, irritable bowel
  syndrome, cancer, autoimmune disease, diabetes and heart disease. This is the first project of its kind in Europe, as an extension
    of the American Gut Project & The Microsetta Initiative, based
    at the University of California San Diego.  We have collaborated
    with TwinsUK at King’s College London so that those living in Europe
    can participate, and with your help, we will be able to discover
    more about the crucial relationship between our health and our
    microbiome, and on a personal level, you will be able to discover
    the bacterial profile of your own gut. With your help, we hope to be
    able to answer questions such as 'How much does our choice of
    lifestyle and diet influence our microbiome, and can we alter our
    microbiome to make us healthier?' We are discovering that each person is very different and has
    their own unique microbiome. More research is needed to work out
    what constitutes a 'healthy' microbiome, and which combinations of
    bacteria are beneficial and which ones should be avoided. In order
    to do this ambitious and much-needed project, we urgently need a
    large scale collection of human samples. Over ten thousand people
    have already signed up in America already through the American Gut
    Project-- but we need many more from Europe. The project mainly focuses on the gut as this is our main
    'microbial home', however, the study will also look at areas like
    the oral and skin, as these areas of the body may be influenced by
    the microbiome. Joining is simple! Select the kit you would like from the list
    of options on the left-hand side by clicking “Claim this perk” found
    on the right side (if you would like to receive a specific number of
    kits that isn’t listed as a perk, email us at info@britishgut.org ). You will receive your kit within 3 weeks after payment. Shipping within the U.K. first class should be around £2.90, but
    we recommend taking the sample to the post office to get the proper
    postage. Getting the postage right on the first try is important
    since samples that spend a long time in transit will likely not
    produce the highest quality results. After you have returned your
    sample to us, we will then be sent to the Knight Lab at the
    University of California San Diego to be processed and analyzed. We estimate that the whole process will take about 4-5
  months. We typically bulk ship samples back to the Knight
  Lab every 1-2 months on dry ice to reduce shipping costs. Once your
  sample is arrives at the Knight Lab (you'll get a notification when
  they have received your sample), it takes approximately 3 months to
  return results. Each kit contains a sample collection device (or multiple if you
    ordered more than one), an instruction packet on how to sample, and
    return envelope(s) to send your sample tube(s) back. Once we provide you with your results, you will receive data
    visualization of how your results compare to other people who are
    within the same diet and lifestyle group as you (having different
    results from them does not necessarily mean anything bad, it can
    just be that you have different lifestyles that make bacterial
    profile is different).   In addition, you will be provided with a
    list of the major groups of bacteria in your sample and their
    relative abundances (based at the genus level). These results are not actionable,
      and we do not provide any personalized interpretation . It will take longer than the expected 4-5 months to receive
      results if you are submitting one of the following sample types: Oral or skin samples. A desktop computer or laptop is recommended to register and log your sample into our
      participant portal website, as our participant website has
      compatibility issues on mobile devices and tablets.  The best
      browser to use when you register your kit is Google Chrome. Note your de-identified information will be part of a
      research study and will be made available in a publicly available
      research database. That is, any personal information that might
      easily identify who you are will be removed before being placed in
      the public database. If you decide that you no longer wish to continue in this
      study, please send a request to the British Gut Project help
      account ( info@britishgut.org ) to inform us of your intent to withdraw. You may request a
      refund within 50 days of your original payment if you have not yet used your kit. Please note that the Fundrazr transaction fee will be
        deducted from your refund. The consent forms are maintained on the participant website;
      details are included in your kit. To sign the consent form, you
      must agree to use an electronic format for your signature in

685,Please help fund for my mother treatment  costs,U.S. Dollar,,of $40k goal,30,"Dear friends, My name is Anatoly. I am from the Republic of Moldova. I would like
  to share my story over the past year and a half. In the year 2017,
  happiness came to our family, I got married, my sister got married
  too, then my wife and I had a son. My sister and her husband moved to
  the United Kingdom for permanent residence. It would seem that everything was fine, everything was getting
  better, a new step in a new life, something completely new, and how
  grate was to give a new life. But in November 2017, the misfortune
  came to our family, two cancerous tumors in the head were found at my
  mother, and a completely different story began. It was decided to excise the tumors surgically. The date of the
  operation was set. Analyses, radiological examination and fluorography
  before the operation, revealed a spot in a lung. The additional
  analyses detected a cancerous tumor in the left lung. The commission of doctors decided to conduct an operation on the
  head, and after that to remove completely the left lung, and take a
  histological analysis. Within one month both operations were
  successfully performed. Histological analysis showed the nidus of cancer in the lung. Next,
  we had to conduct PET - CT (positron emission tomography), this is a
  computer tomography for detecting tumors in the whole body. And it was
  also necessary to complete 5 courses of chemotherapy. The decision was to conduct all the examinations at the Neolife
  Oncological Clinic in Istanbul (Turkey). In January 2018, we went to
  the clinic. We took the analyses, underwent examination and PET
  scanning. The result was disappointing. A stain was found above a kidney and in a bone, and a small tumor in
  the head. The commission of doctors prescribed six courses of
  chemotherapy, injections against bone destruction, and a course of
  radiotherapy. Every three months, an MRI scanning of the head was conducted. At the end of chemotherapy courses, again in Istanbul a PET scan was
  made. All the chemotherapy courses were purchased at the Neolife
  Clinic, and were dripped in Chisinau at the Oncological Clinic. On the 27 of February, 2018, my dad fell down and broke his leg in
  the femoral neck area, an urgent operation was performed, 3 screws for
  bone fusion were installed, the healing time was on average from 4 to
  8 months. Here begins a new stage, but we will not go deeply into it
  and move directly to June 2018. We finished the course of chemotherapy with my mom and the regular
  examination of the leg with my dad. We decided to fly first to
  Istanbul, and then, upon arrival, to examine the father. On the arrival in Istanbul, another PET scanning was made, the results of which were
  quite consolatory. The stain over the kidney disappeared, one remained only in the bone,
  but we continued to drip the injections, which was against the
  destruction of bones. The commission of doctors proposed 4 courses of
  sustaining chemotherapy to fix the results and the next examination at
  the end of the courses. It was like a light at the end of the tunnel. Was that really the end
  of that difficult period of life? We purchased chemotherapy courses
  and went to Chisinau with good news. Upon the arrival we went for an examination with dad, underwent a
  radiological examination. Radiological examination showed that there
  was no coalescence of the femoral neck, and it is necessary to put a
  femoral prosthesis, in 2 months after the installing the prosthesis,
  one can safely walk and live a full life. After choosing the prosthesis and the surgeon to conduct the
  operation, the day of the operation was appointed. The operation was
  successful. In general, everything began to get better, the difficult
  period of life slowly began to move away from us. After the finishing of the courses of supporting chemotherapy, on
  04.11.2018, my mother and I went to Istanbul for another examination,
  full of confidence and hope that everything would be fine. On
  05.11.2018 mom underwent another PET scanning which again made us unhappy. The result showed that another tumor appeared in the head next to the
  place where the last two were removed, a tumor appeared again above
  the kidney and the spot on the bone increased, in the lymph nodes
  where there was the left lung, small trace of possible metastasis was
  found. It was like a blow. Now we have done another analysis for pathology to select the next
  chemotherapy courses, and we are also waiting for the results of a
  consultation of doctors who must decide whether it is possible to
  apply radio emission to remove the tumor from the head. We have gained
  strength and are trying to overcome this disease. With all my heart I want to thank all the relatives, friends and
  those who did not remain indifferent to our situation, for their
  support, for their moral and material assistance. Now we are in a difficult situation, because all our accumulated
  funds have long ended, all that was possible to sell is already sold,
  all where it was possible to lend out is already borrowed and the
  terms of debt recovery are coming around, and now we have no means to
  continue treatment and to return the debts. Debts, which are totaled
  in the amount of $ 39000. And the preliminary sum for the continuation
  of the treatment has not designated yet. For this reason, I indicate
  the amount of the debt. I believe that There must be some kind folks in the world still, and
  I ask to help all who can. I have always been of the opinion that $
  5-10 for many people is not a significant sum, but can help someone to
  save lives. Whenever it was possible, on some fundraising portals, I
  always tried to help people. I sent it and immediately forgot it, but
  I was sure that for the person to whom I sent money it was definitely
  more necessary. Now I am in that situation that I myself need
  financial help and I really hope that this time people will be able to
  help me too. Thank you all.",https://fundrazr.com/tatianat63

      22nd, 2018 to January 1st, 2019 . Orders made during this time will be shipped out when the
    campus reopens on January 2nd, 2019. Please do not send any samples back
      during this time as your sample will be held up in the university
      mailing system until we return, which will affect your sample
      quality.  If you are sending your sample the week prior to
      December 22nd, please make sure it will arrive by December
    21st. This is applicable for Australian Gut, Asian Gut,
    and international participants. The
    Human Microbiome Project and other microbiome projects worldwide
    have laid an important foundation for understanding the trillions of
    microbes that inhabit our bodies and their impact on health and
    disease. However, opportunities for the public to get involved in
    such research have been limited. Now, American Gut gives you an
    opportunity to join this research project and learn what’s living on
    and inside you. American Gut is a project built on the open-source, open-access
    principles of the Earth Microbiome Project. The data we collect is
    de-identified and then deposited into open repositories for the
    benefit of other researchers and scientists.  By participating in
    our project, you can help contribute to research that will help the
    world understand how the microbiome affects our health. In exchange
    for your participation, we generate a report summarizing the types
    of microbes observed in your sample, and how your sample relates to
    other people in the study. While American Gut mainly focuses on the gut as this is where
    most of our microbes reside, we will also look at areas like the
    oral and skin, as these areas of the body also contain microorganisms. The American Gut Project is a part of the Microsetta Initiative , with
    the goal of collecting microbiome samples and rich phenotypic data
    from populations across the globe. Some examples of what we have found using our data: Younger
  children tend to have more proteobacteria composing their microbiome.
   As you grow older, the diversity of your microbiome increases. (Based off our preliminary findings in 2014,
      found here ) There’s a significant difference between the types of bacteria
    found in industrialized populations vs. non-industrialized populations. McDonald et al. mSystems . May 2018. DOI: 10.1128/mSystems.00031-18 Joining is simple! Select the kit you would like from the list
    of options on the right-hand side by clicking “Claim this perk” (if
    you would like to receive a certain number of kits that isn’t listed
    as a perk, email us at info@americangut.org ) . Your kit
    will arrive via USPS within 2 weeks after payment, unless you have added the “Priority Shipping”
    perk along with your kit. If You Live in Europe: Visit our sister site, British Gut , to join. If You Live in Australia or Singapore: While we do have sites set up in Australia and Singapore (known
    as Australian Gut and Asian Gut respectively), we ask that participants contribute an additional $25 on top
    of their contribution, which covers an international shipping fee . These sites allow participants to send their samples back to a
    local site, which then sends the samples back to our lab in the U.S.
    to reduce the costs of shipping. If you live in Australia or Singapore and would like to
    participate, claim a perk.  The next page will have an option to
    ""top off"" your contribution with an additional amount,
    which you will use to add in the $25 to mark your kit to go out. I f you do not include the $25 shipping fee, your kit will not be
      sent out until we have received it. Once we have received your transaction, we will forward your
    information to our collaborators. They will then send out a kit to
    you, which you will receive within 3 weeks . Please note that the r eturn time for results will take significantly longer than the
    expected 3 months for Australian/Asian Gut participants. The reason
    is that we have to bulk ship samples on dry ice back to our lab at
    UC San Diego.  This costs thousands of dollars per shipment, so it’s
    only feasible to do once enough samples are ready to ship. If You Live Anywhere
    Else: International participants are also
    welcome to join. The $25 international shipping fee also applies (which you must include in your contribution), along with other regulations . I f you do not include the $25 shipping fee, your kit will not
      be sent out until we have received it. We also ask that samples are shipped back to our lab within 48 hours of being collected. The cost of expedited shipping to our lab in the U.S. from
    some locations can be expensive , so it is also recommended that you look into the cost of
    return shipping (we recommend using FedEx as it is more reliable). If you are interested in learning the process of our project
    from start to finish, we have a video available here . Each kit contains a sample tube (or more, if ordered), an
    instruction manual on how to register your kit and take a sample,
    credentials to access our participant website, and return
    envelope(s) to send your sample back. Your results will provide a general overview of how your microbial profile
    compares to other participants ( these results are not intended to be medically actionable,
      and we cannot provide any personalized interpretation ). You will also receive a list of the microorganisms found in
    your sample and their relative abundances (based at the genus
    level).  Results are uploaded via our participant website, which you
    will get access to once you register your kit. For stool samples, it will take about 3 months for you to receive your results, and longer for those who are
      participating outside the U.S. (due to shipping procedures to send
      samples back to our lab, which is based at the University of
      California San Diego).  It takes approximately 4-5 months to

225,Tyler's gift,U.S. Dollar,"Dec 25, 2018",of $300 goal,16,"Hi everyone, my name is Molly. I'm a college freshman currently
  living 2,000 miles away from my family. This Christmas, I'll be seeing
  them for the first time in nearly 6 very long months. I couldn't be
  more excited. Every year for Christmas, my family draws names to see which sibling
  we are getting a present for. This year I have Tyler's name. Tyler is
  6 years younger than me, currently in the midst of middle school. He's
  taller than my dad now and has been able to beat me in wrestling for
  years. He likes normal tweenage boy things like Dungeons and Dragons
  and Minecraft. He also loves to read and is a total softie
  around cats and babies. He can fix or build anything. We're betting
  he's going to be an engineer one day. He's currently a red belt in
  taekwondo. He's very emotional and gets down on himself easily when he
  messes up. He has a heart bigger than a house. He helps my mom with
  anything and everything she asks for. He likes to take care of people.
  I've seen him cry so many times when he's unintentionally hurt
  someone's feelings, or when someone says something hurtful to him.
  This kid is smart . He plays the trombone in his school band.
  He has a heart of gold . You can't get such a special kid a pack of socks and a book and call
  it Christmas, especially when you haven't seen him in 6 months. So what do you get him? I had no idea where to start, so I asked him what he wanted. His
  reply is a true testament to his sweet character: ""I want you to
  come home and take me on an adventure!"" An adventure for Christmas! Now I was left with the question of what
  would the best Christmas adventure be? Then I smiled as the idea came:
  EnChroma. I had seen the viral videos, as I'm sure you all have. Tyler
  is red-green colorblind! What better way to show this sweet brother of
  mine something totally new than give him the gift of color? I want so badly for the brilliant light display in my hometown to be
  Tyler's Christmas adventure. I want to give him at least a portion of
  the joy he's brought me in my life for being my little brother. All donations will go directly and solely into making that dream come
  true, and changing Tyler's world forever. I feel uncomfortable asking
  for something I have not earned, but Tyler has definitely earned 10
  times over a pair of EnChroma glasses. This is all for him. So for his sake, I'd like to ask you all to please donate. If
  everyone who sees this were to donate just one dollar, I'd have enough
  for Tyler's gift in minutes. I'm paying all I can, but as a struggling
  college student it's just not enough. Every little bit helps. Please
  donate for Tyler. Please share this for Tyler. I want to give him the
  adventure of a lifetime for Christmas, and all I want to get is to see
  his smile.",https://fundrazr.com/31RAK0
"18,770",HELP TO HEAL OUR SWEET ROSALINA!,,,,,"OUR SWEET AND MOST PRECIOUS FIVE YEAR OLD DAUGHTER
  ROSALINA was diagnosed last month with aggressive, high risk,
  stage IV neuroblastoma, the second most common pediatric cancer after leukemia. Testing was done and has showed that there is a massive primary
  tumour in her abdomen, which is pushing up on her pancreas, liver and
  some blood vessels, and which has spread to some of her lymph nodes,
  causing two other tumours. One is in the nodes behind her heart
  between the lungs, which we are told is inoperable, and one in her
  left clavicle. There are also ""innumerable"" smaller sites
  detected in her abdominal area. The cancerous cells have also been
  found in her bone marrow and in the bones in her thighs, upper arms
  and mid-spinal regions. We are completely devastated and life has ceased to be the
  same as it was before her diagnosis. Everything except Rosalina and
  her baby sibling, to be born any day now, has ceased to be of priority. We have been practically living at the Children's Hospital of Eastern
  Ontario since the diagnosis, and Rosalina has already received two
  cycles of chemotherapy. Her conventional treatment plan is to last a
  year and a half, and is just as aggressive as her cancer. We hope to
  counteract some of its very scary side effects with complementary
  therapies and boost her immune system as much as we can so that she
  has all that she needs to get well and stay well. WE CAN'T LET GO OF THE HOPE AND EFFORTS TO HEAL OUR SWEET ROSALINA! We will apply any feasible treatments and complementary therapies
  that we can- this is why we are raising funds for her. These
  treatments include buying Rosalina all organic foods all of the time,
  purchasing supplements of vitamins and minerals and paying for
  naturopathic therapies such as acupuncture sessions. We are also
  raising funds to help pay for travel costs. Our family sincerely thanks you for your contributions. They will all
  add up to making life easier to manage and help to HEAL OUR
    SWEETEST, MOST PRECIOUS ROSALINA . Blessings!",https://fundrazr.com/HEALROSALINA
"9,065",Empowering Recovery & Financial Relief for our Beloved Blu,Canadian Dollar,"Dec 31, 2018",of $12k goal,83,"I am a person who many of you already know had been in health crisis
  several years ago and the fear that gripped me about my future at the
  time was overwhelming.I am so grateful to have found help in many ways
  to regain all of my health and feel younger and stronger than I have
  in over ten years. It was simply because I was lucky that I stumbled
  across the natural health solutions that led me out of my own private despair. So, my friend and fellow Social Entrepreneur with Evolv Health, Judy
  Adolf,  and I have been talking for some time about using the model of
  social giving to help individuals in our community who are overwhelmed
  with a health challenge. It is through no fault of their own they have
  been buried under financial strain which only compounds their health
  issues. We decided to help people with their health in general by
  creating a Wellness focussed community MEET UP GROUP called
  ""PURPOSEFUL WELLNESS which fulfills a mandate to inspire and
  educate others about nutrition, fitness and natural healing methods
  that can help. But we also added a unique component modelling our own
  Evolv Social Business and created a fundraising platform that could
  greatly impact someone suffering with an illness or disability. Many
  face these challenges quite unexpectedly and the financial strain is
  often beyond their ability to cope. So for the first 3 months of  ""Purposeful Wellness"" we
  decided to help our mutual friend Blu Mankuma who is a well loved
  actor/ entertainer in our community currently on Kidney dialysis who
  can no longer work at his profession. He is a kind and loving soul and
  we thought who better than Blu to be our first recipient in the
  charitable program we have implemented. Our goal initially was to raise 2,000. to contribute to his meagre
  income from pensions and disability and since the campaign was so
  successful we have decided to keep going for another 2 months as we
  can see this has brought him such relief and he has a long ways to
  go.. This would to take some of the strain off him so he can buy
  healthy food , pay his rent and perhaps regain some strength through
  an immune support product that he could otherwise never afford. Blu Mankuma's Health Story- ""I'm an actor/director, singer/songwriter and producer.
    When I was in college I began noticing a little swelling around my
    ankles and when I went to the doctor and after several tests, he
    gave me salt pills and told me to keep him apprised. But he had no
    answers and for years the swelling continued. No matter how many
    tests the doctors did, they still had no answers. A few years ago I
    was having dinner, when I felt the need to throw up. On route to the
    bathroom, I lost my balance, I fell and was unable to get up which
    surprised the heck out of me!! I felt like the lady in the
    commercial who says,""help! I've fallen and I can't get up""
    That episode led me to the ICU at VGH for a while and then I was put
    on dialysis which I now do 3 times a week for 4 1/2 sessions. I'm
    unable to do much film work and find it hard to get by on pension
    and disability funds and it has been a struggle just to pay rent. However, I remain positive that one day my kidneys will return to full
    function but until then, I continue to fight the good fight! I'm
    still one of the most blessed individuals on the planet.",https://fundrazr.com/BluMankuma

    here - En español aqui He was hospitalized with a
  aggressive tissue decaying infection in his left leg below the knee
  December 2016 with the initial diagnoses by several doctors to
  amputate the leg above the knee. Dr. Mar Chavira at Salvatierra
  hospital in La Paz did not share that opinion and initiated treatment
  and procedures to rescue the limb and avoid an pending
  amputation. The goal of this fundraising..if met...would cover
  our medical expenses incurred so far (+/-9,500,-US $) as well the cost
  of living / debt accumulated during the time of the illness and
  recovery without any income and would supply the funding required to
  find another rental moving to a better location with option to work
  for him (+/- 5500,-US $) Please read explanation in details further
  down and in the blog we have started. Basically we are not capable on our own power to leave the
  sub-average lifestyle zone we are in right now and funding would
  provide a huge help to Thomas Ernst and me assisting to restart our
  life to a ""normal"", simple lifestyle level again. This
  is basically ""our story"" in a nutshell. Please read in
  detail below and may consider making a donation to allow T.E. to get
  back to work, to manage the significant debt accumulated from his
  battle with the infection. A donation of any kind will be greatly
  appreciated and would be a huge help. Also, please feel free to
  forward on the link to anyone you think might be interested in
  supporting the cause. Please use this contact form If you have
  any questions. Otherwise, thank you for your time and consideration of
  this effort to help Thomas Ernst and
  me. --------------------------------------------------- We
  do not have a professional background to create such fundraiser pages
  as this here in the proper way and writing. My English also has
  severe flaws and I apologize for that. It is work in progress as
  we been forced to change the fundraiser platform due to the
  circumstances that prior used crowdfund Youcaring merged with GoFundMe
  and by their policy is Mexico a Non-GoFundMe supported Country
    and they will shut down. You find info on this here You can see screenshots of received donations during the past 2
  weeks here on our blog . The prior campaign did not generate any support since put online June
  2017 until Maria and a local good Samaritan, Francisco Lopez, reached
  out at the Baja Nomads forum and made the
  situation known at the beginning of May 2018. Them folks made already
  a HUGE impact on our life. Having everyday ""real"" food
  (prior eating for weeks beans & rice or Marushan), all medical
  supplies required and having made some payments to most pressing debt
  collectors, have electricity and communication secured. All this is
  already a big relieve creating some breathing space. Also here
  you find the progress in several sets of images from December 2016 on
  until August 2017 when we had to see phone with camera used. Please be
  aware - some of this images are VERY graphical and not for everybody's
  stomach to view!!! Album - Gallery until August 2017 here on Google documents . We have genuinely tried during the past 18 month to progress yet the
  combination of advancing the healing with ambulant treatment (the
  first 6 month 2-3x per week hospital visits), the cost of medication,
  medical supplies and transportation, basic cost of living - rent,
  electricity, telefon, food was in dimensions to large to cope for us.
  Ernst Thomas has no family or relatives, Maria has a small income from
  a clerical position in a hotel working night-shifts. We have sold any valuables to create funds, we have no vehicle. Ernst

  recently left my job due to health cercumstances and believe this
  bucket list project will be the boost I need to get me through this
  difficult time. I would love the opportunity to ride the rails coast to coast. I
  don't need a fancy cabin just a rail pass and the time to experience
  the almost spiritual nature of solitary travel. Thank you for your generosity and compassion. The money raised will
  go toward the train ticket and lodging. The trip will take several on,
  off connections between cities so economy lodging is a part of the cost. Without your help this would not be possible.",https://fundrazr.com/c1Oi88

  about my gender dysphoria and healthcare decisions to a public
  audience. I wish I could just tell you all the other awesome places
  ways you could use your money, and most of all I wish that we didn't
  live in a culture where healthcare feels so unattainable for so many
  people. But the truth is, this is really important to me, and I think
  will make a big difference for the rest of my life. Top surgery is
  something that has felt out of the question for me for the past 14
  years due to various health issues. I now feel like it is a real
  possibility, and I feel more clear than ever that it's what I want.
  The biggest roadblock still in my way is the money. Since I'm only
  able to work part-time, I don't have much in the way of savings, or
  paid time off. So I'm here asking you for support, because raising
  money is actually way more doable than solving a lot of other problems
  in the world! And I'm so grateful and honored to have a community that
  can be part of this process with me. Here's how the estimated costs break down: $8350 - the surgery itself and hospital fees $2650 - funds to
  cover recovery supplies, lost wages and rental income for the 2-6
  weeks I’ll have to be off work and unable to rent out my guest room,

  During transport breathing worsened and oxygen tubes were taped on his
  face to assist with his breathing. After no progress, they needed to
  increase his oxygen levels so he was moved to the ICU with an oxygen
  mask put on his chubby cheek face. They were able to remove *some*
  mucus, but it was very little progress. Due to still not seeing progress, Baby Izekiel was sedated and
  intubated and remains in the ICU. Please pray for this sweet boy and his family while he's fighting to
  recover and *hopefully* be healthy enough to get back to the comfort

"7,288",Zach Branson's Medical Fundraiser,U.S. Dollar,,of $15k goal,57,"Zachary Branson was born with a liver disease known as biliary
  atresia. The main procedure that was performed is known as a Kasai
  portoenterostomy. This operation connects the bile drainage from the
  liver directly to the intestinal tract. Success of this procedure may
  be improved when it is done before an infant is 8 weeks old. The Kasai
  procedure is helpful because it permits bile to flow and can allow a
  child to grow and remain in fairly good health for many years. It is
  important to understand that this surgery is typically a treatment for
  and not cure of biliary atresia. Ongoing liver disease is likely to
  continue to occur even with a successful operation. Up to 80 percent
  of children who undergo the Kasai portoenterostomy will eventually
  need to have a liver transplant. Doctors warned that Zach would not
  live past the age of 2 years old. Now at 30 years old, Zach has
  surprised the medical community. He has gone through quite rough times
  in his life growing up with this disease. His mother passed away in
  2006 from liver and kidney failure due to alcoholism. Zach cannot work
  a ""normal"" job anymore due to complications that arise from
  this disease. He is currently in the process of fighting for

  very sick with a rare nerve condition, Lymes Disease and Bells Palsy

  getting much worse and we need to raise funds urgently sooner rather
  than later! An Everest base camp trek is the adventure of a lifetime. The path
  begins in ancient Kathmandu, where I'll acclimate anticipate my
  ascent. My trek to Everest Base Camp at 5,364m (over 3.5 miles!) to
  the base of the world's tallest mountain will take me over suspension
  bridges spanning chasms of thin air, through hidden Buddhist
  monasteries, and into the heart of the warm, rugged Sherpa culture. It's going to be a 15 day climb with the biggest difficulty being the

"9,963",Hannah's Heroes,U.S. Dollar,,of $177k goal,234,"Our daughter Hannah was born with 2 very rare diseases 1 called C.A.H
  and the other called Spinal Muscular Atrophy, which works to rob her
  of her ability to move, breath and, eventually, live. There is a drug
  that can stop this disease. It has just approved it. But accessing it
  costs $177,000, and the process of our drug plan won’t be ready for
  another year. That’s a year that our little girl can’t afford to wait.
  It would be a year of vulnerability and loss. But with your
  help, we believe we can turn it into a year of miracles! Let me
  tell you the rest of our story. Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) has
  become our daily life. It’s the genetic condition most likely to kill
  children under six years of age, and our daughter has it. It’s a
  progressive lower motor neuron disease, that is loosely paralleled to
  adult ALS. But there are significant differences: most notably, SMA
  never affects cognition, so our daughter is as bright and keen as any
  other child her age. At 14 months, Hannah took her first 3 steps. She has never walked
  since then. After those first steps, she lost any strength to walk,
  then strength to pull up to stand, and then the strength to crawl. She
  can barely get from a lying position to a sitting position. Hannah is
  our mature little scholar! But she is completely dependant on us for
  dressing, toileting, and getting her in her wheelchair.But those
  things aren’t the worst. She is at an extreme risk of respiratory
  failure. Every single simple cold/viral infection is a threat. At
  least three times a year these infections strike hard enough to send
  her to the hospital. As a parent, I weep and get nauseous just
  thinking about this. I don’t want to think about what the next year
  could hold for her. But the amazing thing is that it doesn’t have
  to be that kind of year for our little girl. For over two decades
  the gene responsible for SMA has been known but there has not been a
  single available treatment. This past summer the first drug in history
  to specifically treat SMA was approved ! It is called Spinraza
  (Nusinersen). It can completely halt SMA in its path and even lead to
  some GAIN in muscle strength! This drug truly is a miracle, and
  we need our daughter on it as soon as possible. Though it’s
  approved Spinraza won’t be available on our drug plans for another
  year. It costs $177,000 to provide a year’s supply for Hannah 3 vials
  . The manufacturer, Biogen, will sell it directly to families willing
  to pay for it. This treatment WILL stop Hannah's respiratory deterioration, keep her
  hands strong, and prevent future problems in her spine that would
  require surgery.And we don’t even know what gains it might provide.
  Instead of a year of atrophy it can become a year of miracles! But we
  need your help. We do everything we can for our little girl but we
  can’t do this alone. We need to raise $177,000. Please join us
  on our journey and help to make this a year of miracles for Hannah",https://fundrazr.com/HannahsHeroes
"12,100",Help Zuberi Walk Again With Stem Cell Treatment!!!,U.S. Dollar,"Dec 31, 2018",of $85k goal,3,"https://youtu.be/qAHDUtt8YAA In 1993 in Oakland, CA at age 23, Zuberi Mwanathaura became the
  unintentional target in a gun shooting. In the aftermath that
  followed, he was ultimately rendered paralyzed from the chest down and
  wheelchair bound. The shooter’s bullet was meant for his cousin, but
  he was caught in the crossfire, an irony, since he had lived as a law
  abiding citizen his entire life; making his goal to stay clear of
  drugs and violence, unfortunately it became his nemesis. Zuberi lived a very positive and active life before, which he still
  maintains since the tragedy. Albeit, he grew up in the inner city and
  managed to avoid major incidents of violence involving guns, drugs and
  gangs. He knew it was incumbent to remain focused on his goals of
  living a very disciplined life by never drinking alcohol or using any
  kind of drugs, thus avoiding conduits possibly predisposing themselves
  such a tragic outcome. Zuberi at the very time of the shooting worked
  three jobs, seven days a week, while raising two children along with
  pursuing his goals and dreams of being an entertainer (actor, model,
  dancer, rapper and writer). Post the immediacy of the incident, he has
  survived two life threatening surgeries with his heart stopping twice
  on the operating table. Afterwards, and as he convalesced, while
  bedridden for a year, with countless prayers, tears, family and
  community support, he regained physical strength and emotional
  resiliency (although punctuated by intense, constant, and chronic pain
  related to the remaining bullet fragments in his spinal cord and
  chest; 25 years post-incident, he continues to endure the never-ending
  constant, excruciating, chronic, physical pain induced by the bullet
  fragments that remained in his spine). Once stabilization period peaked Zuberi began volunteering by
  mentoring to youth, doing motivational speaking engagements, at
  numerous schools, churches, and social programs; ALL at his own
  expense never charging a fee for his services! Desirous of furthering
  his formal education, Zuberi went back to school and began to
  matriculate his degree and in May, 2000 he was conferred with a
  Bachelor of Arts degree in History Education from Clark Atlanta
  University in Atlanta, Georgia. Currently Zuberi has a T4 Spinal Cord injury, as well as bone on bone
  cartilage wrist damage, as a result of 25 years of confinement in his
  wheelchair and years of operating his wheelchair manually. His
  recommended treatment for his condition is Stem Cell Treatment and
  Rehabilitation. He is requesting this project be funded As Soon As
  Possible in order for him to benefit from this crucial and essential
  surgery. In addition, he is a prolific writer and film producer with
  an ultimate goal to complete his book and documentary projects titled,
  “Dreaming Beyond My Circumstances”; highlighting  his “ tragedy to
  triumph” story to encourage others that no matter what their adversity
  in life or circumstances they live with, to never give up. Zuberi
  hopes to exemplify that you can still make it no matter your
  circumstances. He wants to shout from the mountaintops, “Just don’t
  give up on your dreams, goals and aspirations, and NEVER give up the
  fight!” His ultimate goal is to walk, dance and run again through this
  vital Stem Cell Treatment. On behalf of Zuberi Mwanathaura, we wish to Thank You in advance for
  your prayers, your financial support, your love and sharing his story
  through social media, and with your friends & families. Please join us in our campaign to Help Zuberi Walk Again in 2018!! Speech in link below of Zuberi doing a Motivational Speech to High

  he had a reaction to the Octagam and caused him to end up in hospital
  having lumbar punctures, MRI scans and sonars.  Unfortunately he is
  now unable to receive the Octagam as its a gamble as to whether or not
  he would have the same issues happen again. The option now is to move
  to the subcutaneous medication which is extremely costly. The medical
  aid will cover a portion of this every month, but I am short R5000 per
  month on a 4 week month and R10000 on a 5 week month.  There is also
  the cost of a pump to purchase of over R8000 which medical aid does

  and strength I still have. He told me that the most important thing is
  just to KEEP MOVING. Therein lies the problem, though, because the hip
  is a weight bearing joint and walking is painful. As my mobility has
  decreased, my weight has increased which puts even more strain on the
  hip. It's a vicious cycle. I know what you're thinking, ""Why not
  just get a hip replacement?"" Believe me, many friends have asked
  the same question but unfortunately, because of other health issues,
  surgery is not a viable option for me. Then I found a mobility device called the Alinker (see video), a three-wheeled walking bike designed to help people remain
    active, do what they love, and build strength so they can live life
    to the fullest. It's an alternative to the typical
    ""walker"" or a motorized scooter. My goal is to
  remain active as a volunteer in my church and my community. I work in
  a food pantry, volunteer often at my church as well as sing in my
  church choir, and I also participate in a community chorus that
  performs regularly at community events and nursing homes. The Alinker is not covered by insurance. As you know, insurance
  companies do not have a vested interest in keeping us healthy. But
  staying healthy is MY goal and I'm asking for your help by way of a
  donation to my campaign. Anything you can do will be helpful and I
  thank you in advance for your support.",https://fundrazr.com/01Q2F8

"9,059",Road to Healing: Help Col with treatment and life!,U.S. Dollar,,of $42k goal,91,"A Message from Maria ... When I picture my friend Col, I envision light—a beautiful, warm,
  loving light. Her aura glows with this willingness to understand and empathize. That’s one of the reasons why this disease she has been battling is
  so difficult for me to come to grips with. It seems to be literally
  eating away at the insides of her physical body, and yet her mind and
  her spirit still keep glowing—still keep pushing on—despite the daily
  obstacles she faces. Col does not like to complain so she doesn't want us to list all of
  her symptoms, which are many. When you see her smiling and laughing
  with you, she's doing it amidst great pain and discomfort. Often it
  feels like she's dying. A number of her doctors don't take insurance and need to be paid out
  of pocket (just one office visit can cost $600!) and the treatment
  they prescribe is also not covered by insurance. She has been sick for
  numerous years so you can imagine the toll that that takes. Her illness is not something you'd know about unless you are close to
  her. But it's very serious and it severely impedes her quality of
  life. And her closest friends and family are very concerned— *We want her to be with us for years to come!* Please join me in doing what you can to help Col win this war within
  her body and pave her road to healing. A Message from Sue Elliott ... Have you ever met somebody — even online — and instantly loved that person? I’m not talking about lust. I’m not even talking about appreciation. What I mean is some sort of deep, soul-level recognition. A
  feeling like “home,” like “It’s so good to see you again after all
  these years! I do so adore you!” That’s how I felt about Col the first time I saw her photo and
  read a comment she had posted online in a business-oriented group
  years ago. Since then, I’ve gotten to know Col “better,” and I still have
  that same feeling. She’s like a cross between an angel, a friend and a sister! We have amazing conversations in which we both let go of all
  kinds of “stuff” that no longer serves us and we experience huge AHA moments! If you had asked me a year or so ago how I felt about Col, I
  would have told you that she’s a dear, dear friend, at the very least. And yet, as close as we had gotten on so many levels, I
  had NO idea that Col was often in severe physical pain. Not only does she not complain about pain, she’s so genuinely
  joyful and inspired and inspiring, it never dawned on me that she
  could be anything but energetic and “healthy.” Her very being exudes well-being! Col wrote a beautiful blog post that illustrates her approach to
  life and living, even in the midst of pain... even in the midst of
  illness. Please take a couple minutes to be inspired by the beauty of
  Col’s approach to — and dance with — life: Dancing in the Rain . Throughout the pain and the illness, Col has been giving to
  others in the most magnificent way. She created a FREE program called Magical Medical Mystery Tour , in which she
  interviewed amazing healers of all kinds. She created a forum in which
  these experts shared their wisdom freely with anyone who cared to
  participate. The gift of these interviews continues to unfold within
  me and, I’m sure, within all who were game for the adventure. So when Col told me that she now has one or two Western medical
  doctors for EACH of her organs! —and as much as she loves and
  appreciates them, Western medicine doesn’t seem to be working for her
  particular illness — I didn’t have to ask if she had tried natural and
  alternative healing modalities. I knew she had — with joy and
  enthusiasm and insight ... And yet, her body still has more to say — more insights to
  reveal — and it wants to reveal those insights and that wisdom through
  biological medicine. Col has received many “nudges” from the universe
  pointing her in that direction — and this is a woman who KNOWS how to
  listen to and dance with the universe. Like all great dances, it’s a two-way experience. There is
  giving and receiving. And there is constant expansion. One of the most obvious — and magnificent — benefits of this
  expansive dance with the universe and with pain and illness has been
  creativity. Everything that Col learns and experiences goes deep
  within her being and comes out as ART! Art with spirit. Art with soul. Art with purpose. And art that
  is infused with the energy of healing and a return to balance and wholeness! If you feel inspired, I encourage you to listen to your soul.
  Listen to your body. Listen to your inner response to Col’s artwork.
  And if something resonates deeply within you, please purchase it. Not only will you be bringing something beautiful and powerful
  into your own home or office, you will be helping to make Col’s dream
  come true, the universe-directed dream to receive biological treatment. I know I will be buying several pieces of Col’s work for myself
  and to give as gifts. And I know I will not be alone. Col is so loved
  by so many! Sue Elliott Founder/Editor-in-Chief of Law of Attraction Magazine www.LovingMyself.com ..................................................

"20,915",Help Geoffrey Walk Again,U.S. Dollar,,of $22k goal,65,"Hi, My name is Sarah and I'm trying to raise money to help my big
  brother, Geoffrey. My entire life, Geoffrey has been an amazing athlete; he's someone
  who could out run, out climb and out catch anyone. My first memory is
  sitting on the bleachers when I was three watching his baseball games;
  to be honest I mostly liked going for the hot dogs, but I still
  remember watching him run around the bases in a flash of white, blue
  and dust. As I grew up, Geoffrey was someone I always looked up to -- he was
  the amazing skateboarding ninja, a rock climber, adventurer, surfer,
  accomplished chef and snowboarder. When I was 13, he was living and
  snowboarding full time in Salt Lake City, Utah. One of my happiest
  memories was watching him win a snowboarding competition - long before
  snowboarding was an Olympic sport. He was a natural on the snow, able
  to move across, around and over it like a bird gliding over the currents. Now, Geoffrey has trouble walking. He's developed avascular necrosis
  - or bone death - in both of his ankles. I didn't know what that meant
  either when he first told me. What it does mean is that he's in
  constant pain  and has trouble walking.  I do know that it's very rare
  to develop this in the ankles, especially in people as young as he is,
  and that it's very difficult to fix. After seeing many doctors and specialists over the past two years,
  he's finally going to be able to have surgery at the  San Francisco
  Orthopedic Surgery Center in July. They've told him he'll have to have
   arthroscopic surgery on each ankle -- which means going into the
  joint and scraping away the damage and fixing the bone, ligament and
  cartilage as they go along. In some ways Geoffrey is lucky; if the
  surgery goes well, then he'll be able to walk again without having to
  have his ankle joints replaced. To make this happen my mom, Elizabeth Worley, and Geoffrey have been
  looking for a way to make sure Geoffery can get the surgery and
  support he needs to walk again. His insurance will cover most of the
  surgery cost itself, but he'll need to have intensive rehab and
  physical therapy to help him heal and be able to walk again -- and it
  could take between six and eight months for both ankles to heal.  And
  this is where we need your help. For an additional $25,000, we can cover everything his insurance
  won't and make sure he has the support he needs to heal. This mean
  Geoffrey will be able to walk again, be able to work again, and, while
  his snowboarding days are behind him, with your help he'll be able to
  keep up with his amazing dog, Max.",https://fundrazr.com/11Md51
